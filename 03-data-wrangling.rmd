### In brief

> Most time in data analysis is spent 'tidying up' data: getting it into a suitable format to get
> started. Data scientists have a particular definition of _tidy_: Tidy datasets are "easy to
> manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each
> observation is a row" [@wickham_tidy_2014].

> It's often not convenient for humans to _enter_ data in a tidy way, so untidy data is probably
> more common than tidy data in the wild. But doing good, reproducible science demands that we
> document each step of our processing in a way that others can check or repeat in future. Tools
> like R make this easier.



# Overview

In previous worksheets we used various commands in the `tidyverse`, like `filter` and `group_by`. 

If you want to recap these commands you can use the cheatsheet, especially
the part on groups and summaries.


Today we will cover three additional techniques which are important when working with real datasets:

-   Creating new variables/columns
-   'Pivoting' or reshaping data from long to wide formats (or the reverse)
-   Joining two sources of data (e.g. two spreadsheets) into a single dataframe




# Before you start

- Make sure you complete the worksheet on [exploring data](01-exploring-data.html) and [plotting](02-plotting.html)
- Remember to load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Making new variables

Sometimes we need to create new columns in our dataset. For example, let's say we wanted to
calculate someone's BMI from their weight and height.

There is a built in dataset called `women`, which contains heights and weights of 15 women in lbs
and inches:

```{r}
women  %>% glimpse
```

To calculate a BMI we first need to convert the heights to from inches to meters, and the weights
from lbs to kilograms.

```{r}
metric_women <- women  %>%
  mutate(
    height_m = height*0.0254,  # approx conversion from inches to m
    weight_kg= weight*0.45     # conversion from lbs to kg
  )
```

**Explanation**: We used the  `mutate` function to covert lbs to kg and inches to m, and saved these two new columns in a new dataset called `metric_women`.

We can see the new columns here:

```{r}
metric_women %>% head(3)
```


BMI is calculated as $\dfrac{kg}{m^2}$. We can use mutate again for this:

```{r}
metric_women  %>%
  mutate(BMI = weight_kg / height_m^2) %>%
  head(3)
```

**Explanation**: We used mutate again to make a new column, `BMI`. This contains womens' weight
divided by their squared height (`^2` means _to the power of 2_ in R-speak).

:::{.exercise}

-   Create a density plot of BMI scores in the `women` dataset. It should look like this:

```{r, echo=F}
bmis <- metric_women %>% mutate(BMI = weight_kg / height_m^2)
bmis %>%
 ggplot(aes(BMI)) +
 geom_density()
```

-   What is the median BMI in the sample? `r fitb(answer=round(median(bmis$BMI),1))`

# Pivoting (reshaping)

Data is commonly stored in either
[_wide_ or _long_ format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/).

If you used SPSS to do a _t_-test or ANOVA during your undergraduate degree, you likely analysed the
data in **wide** format. 

In wide format, each row represents the _observations from a single
participant_. Each measurement for a given participant are stored in separate columns.

This is often called **row per subject** data. An example is the built in `attitude` dataset:

```{r}
attitude %>%
  head()
```

**Explanation**: Each row contains scores for a particular employee on various measures. To find out
more about these data you can type `?attitude` into the console.

---


Let's say we want a single plot of all these variables, something like this:

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(data.table)
attitude %>%
  as.data.table() %>%
  melt() %>%
  mutate(variable=Hmisc::capitalize(as.character(variable))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Measure", y="Score")
```


To do this we first need to convert the data to _long_ format. In **long format**, each observation
is saved in its own row, rather than across multiple columns.

It's often called **"row per observation"** data.

---

Pivoting is where you take a long data file (lots of rows, few columns) and make it wider. Or where you take a wide data file (lots of columns, few rows) and make it longer. 


We can convert from wide to long using the `pivot_longer` command. 


![Another term sometimes used for pivoting data to long form is `melting` img: [TrueWarrior](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/ppam4/ice_cream_melting_and_remelting/)](https://i.imgur.com/UBGhu.gif)


To see why the command is called 'pivot_longer', imagine trying to reshape just the first two rwos of the attitude dataset:

```{r  echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  head(2)
```

If we use `pivot_longer` on this selection, we end up with this:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  pivot_longer(everything())
```

**Explanation of the command**: We selected a subset of columns and rows. Then we used `pivot_longer(everything())` to make this into long form data. The `everything()` tells R to merge values from all of the columns into a single new column called `value`, and to keep track of the original variable name in a new column called `name`)


The change works like like this:

![Converting from wide format to long format](media/data_wide2Long_attitude.jpg)

In this example we don't have an explicit record of which participant was which in the `attitude`
dataset, because the mapping to participants was implicit: each row was a new participant, but they
were not marked.


We can make this explicit by adding a new column to the data with the `mutate` and `row_number()` commands:

```{r}
attitude_with_person <- attitude %>%
  mutate(person = row_number()) %>%
  head(2)

attitude_with_person
```

But now, if we `pivot_longer` again, we will need to tell R which columns
we would like to pivot. If we don't the `person` column gets melted with everything else
so we lose track of which response belonged to which participant:


```{r}
attitude_with_person %>%
  pivot_longer(everything())
```


We can exclude `person` from the pivoting by writing:

```{r, include=F, echo=T}
attitude_with_person %>%
  pivot_longer(-person)
```

**Explanation of the command**: Here, we still use `pivot_longer` but this time we put `-person` between the parentheses. The minus sign, `-`, means *don't include this variable*, so `-person` ends up meaning  *include all columns except `person`*, which is what we wanted.



:::{.exercise}

Use the tidyverse commands you know plus `pivot_longer` to produce this plot using the `attitude` data:

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  select(rating, complaints, learning) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(variable=Hmisc::capitalize(as.character(name))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Measure", y="Score")
```

```{r, echo=F, include=F, eval=F}
attitude %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(variable=Hmisc::capitalize(as.character(name))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Measure", y="Score") +
  coord_flip()
ggsave('examples/pivotboxplot.png', width=4, height=2.5, dpi = 200)
```

# Pivoting data to make summaries

Imagine we want a table of the mean score for each question in the attitude dataset. 

This would be fiddly if we just tried to use summarise on wide format data. But if we use `pivot_longer`, `group_by` and then `summarise` (in that order) it's possible to take the data and make a table like this with 3 instructions to R:

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
attitude %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  group_by(Name=name) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(value), SD=sd(value))
```

:::{.exercise}

Combine the `pivot_longer`, `group_by` and `summarise` commands (in that order) to reproduce the table above.

Hints:

- You want to pivot all of the variables in the attitude dataset this time
- We covered using `summarise` in the first and second worksheets. If you want a reminder, the cheatsheet might be the quickest place to look

# Pivoting wider

Sometimes we have the opposite problem: We have long data, but want it in wide format. For example,
we might want a table where it's easy to compare between different years, like this:


```{r}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols=country, names_from=year, values_from=gdpPercap) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  pander::pander("GDP per-capita in 3 countries in 3 different years, from the gaminder dataset.")
```


----


**Instead of `pivot_longer`, now we want to `pivot_wider`.**


--- 

As we saw before the `gapminder` data is a fairly long format. There are multiple rows per-country
corresponding to different years.

Let's say we want to pivot `gapminder` to a wide format to _compare_ GDP in different years. We first need to select the data we want --- country, year and GDP:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
gapminder1990s <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)
```

Then we `pivot_wider`:

```{r}
gapminder1990s %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = gdpPercap) %>% 
  head()
```

**Explanation of the command and output**: We started with multiple rows per country, corresponding to years. We
used `pivot_wider` with `names_from = year` to create new columns for each year in the data. We used `values_from=gdpPercap` to tell `pivot_longer` to use the GDP numbers to populate the table.
The resulting table helps us compare years within countries, or between countries for a given year.



:::{.exercise}

Experiment for yourself with `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`:

-   Try using pivot_longer with some different datasets, perhaps `iris` and `mtcars`
- Use the pivoted data with `group_by` to create summary tables
