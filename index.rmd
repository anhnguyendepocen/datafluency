# Overview {-}

### Format of the sessions

We have 16 sessions, which work as follows:

-   We avoid extended lectures. This doesn't work well with this subject matter.
-   The focus is on learning by doing (this is more like cooking than chemisty).
-   In the first hour of each session we will (mostly) work together.
-   In the second hour your work will be self-paced, or in small groups.
-   Activities in the workshops are variable in length, sometimes you will
    finish early, other times you may be expected to complete the activities
    outside of class.

### Lab diary

# Access to R

Throughout the module we use R for data processing and analysis.

If you are taking this course at Plymouth University, the easiest way to run the
code examples here is to the school's RStudio Server.

-   [Login to your account on the server here](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk)
-   To get an account on the server, or reset a password,
    [contact the Psychology technical office](http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/)

#### Installing at home

If you want to install R on your own machine, instructions are available here:

Be sure to install the recommended packages or the examples given here won't
work.
